# Banking System Database

The **Banking System Database** is designed to efficiently manage customer accounts and transactions in a simplified banking environment. It demonstrates essential database operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries using MySQL. This project provides a foundational understanding of how banking systems handle and record financial data.

---

## Project Overview

The Banking System Database consists of two main tables — **Accounts** and **Transactions** — that work together to simulate real-world banking operations.  
Every deposit or withdrawal is recorded as a transaction, and the account balance is updated manually using SQL queries (without triggers).  

This structure provides a clear and educational approach to understanding relational databases and their interconnections in financial systems.
